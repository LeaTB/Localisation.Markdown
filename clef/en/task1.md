## Task 1:  What is in (or out)? Select passages to include in a simplified summary, given a query.

Given an article from a major international newspaper for a general audience, this task aims at retrieving from a large scientific bibliographic database with abstracts, all passages that would be relevant to illustrate this article. Extracted passages should be adequate to be inserted as plain citations in the original paper. Sentence pooling and automatic metrics will be used to evaluate these results. The relevance of the source document will be evaluated as well as potential unresolved anaphora issues.

*Output format:*  
 
A maximum of 1000 passages to be included in a simplified summary in a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file with the following fields:
* *run_id*: Run ID starting with team_id_
* *manual*: Whether the run is manual {0,1}
* *topic_id*: Topic ID
* *doc_id*: Source document ID
* *passage*: Text of the selected passage
* *rank*: Passage rank

*run_id &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manual &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; topic_id &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doc_id &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rank*

**Disclaimer:** By downloading and using these data, you agree to the terms of use. Any use of the data for any purpose other than academic research, would be in violation of the intended use of these data. 

Therefore, by downloading and using these data you give the following assurances with respect to the SimpleText data:
1. You will not use nor permit others to use the data in the SimpleText datasets in any way except for classes and academic research.
2. You will not at any time disclose, give, or transmit (in any manner or form or for any purpose) the data (or any portion thereof) to any location or person, including but not limiting to making the data available on the Internet, and copying the data onto any cloud-based storage system.
3. You will not release nor permit others to release the dataset or any part of it to any person. 

In case of violation of the conditions for access to the data for scientific purposes, this access may be withdrawn from the research entity and/or from the researcher. The research entity may also be liable to pay compensation for damages for third parties or asked to take disciplinary action against the offending researcher. 


### Evaluation  
Sentence pooling and automatic metrics will be used to evaluate these results. The relevance of the source document will be evaluated as well as potential unresolved anaphora issues.

OUTPUT example:

| run_id | manual | topic_id | doc_id | passage | rank |
|:-------|:-------|:---------|:-------|:--------|:-----|
| ST1_1 | 1 | 1 | 3000234933 | People are becoming increasingly comfortable using Digital Assistants (DAs) to interact with services or connected objects. | 1 |
| ST1_1 | 1 | 1 | 3003409254 | big data and machine learning (ML) algorithms can result in discriminatory decisions against certain protected groups defined upon personal data like gender, race, sexual orientation etc. | 2 |
| ST1_1 | 1 | 1 | 3003409254 | Such algorithms designed to discover patterns in big data might not only pick up any encoded societal biases in the training data, but even worse, they might reinforce such biases resulting in more severe discrimination. | 3 |
